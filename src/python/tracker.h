/**
 * Helper class for tracking state variables during control flow operations.
 *
 * This class reads and writes state variables as part of control flow
 * operations such as :py:func:`dr.while_loop() <while_loop>` and
 * :py:func:`dr.if_stmt() <if_stmt>`. It checks that each variable remains
 * consistent across this multi-step process.
 *
 * Consistency here means that:
 *
 * - The tree structure of the :ref:`PyTree <pytrees>` PyTree is preserved
 *   across calls to :py:func:`read()`` and :py:func:`write()``.
 *
 * - The type of every PyTree element is similarly preserved.
 *
 * - The sizes of Dr.Jit arrays in the PyTree remain compatible across calls to
 *   :py:func:`read()` and :py:func:`write()`. The sizes of two arrays ``a``
 *   and ``b`` are considered compatible if ``a+b`` is well-defined (it's okay
 *   if this involves an intermediate broadcasting step.)
 *
 * In the case of an inconsistency, the implementation generates an error
 * message that identifies the problematic variable by name.

     * \brief Create a new variable tracker

     * The constructor accepts two parameters:
     *
     * - ``strict``: Certain types of Python objects (e.g. custom Python classes
     *   without ``DRJIT_STRUCT`` field, scalar Python numeric types) are not
     *   traversed by the variable tracker. If ``strict`` mode is enabled, any
     *   inconsistency here will cause the implementation to immediately give up
     *   with an error message. This is not always desired, hence this behavior
     *   is configurable.
     *
     * - ``check_size``: If set to ``true``, the tracker will ensure that
     *   variables remain size-compatible. The one case in Dr.Jit where this is
     *   not desired are evaluated loops with compression enabled (i.e.,
     *   inactive elements are pruned, which causes the array size to
     *   progressively shrink).
