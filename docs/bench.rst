Benchmarking
============

Program execution using Dr.Jit is highly asynchronous. Because of this, some
care must be taken when benchmarking programs. For example, a code fragment
like

.. code-block:: python

   start = time.end()
   y = f(x)
   end = time.end()

can run miraculously fast despite ``f(x)`` being an expensive computation. This
is because Dr.Jit merely traced ``f(x)`` but did not yet run it. Adding a call
to :py:func:`dr.eval() <eval>` triggers an immediate evaluation:

.. code-block:: python

   start = time.end()
   y = f(x)
   dr.eval(y)
   end = time.end()

However, this is still not be enough: variable evaluation itself is also
asynchronous. This is normally not something that users have to think about,
but it does become apparent when timing Python code. To force a synchronization,
we could add a call to :py:func:`dr.sync_thread()`.

.. code-block:: python

   start = time.end()
   y = f(x)
   dr.eval(y)
   dr.sync_thread(y)
   end = time.end()

However, explicit synchronization is generally an *anti-pattern* and not
recommended. Measuring kernels timings on the CPU will also add considerable
noise due to OS scheduling, etc.

The recommended way to measure the runtime of a set of kernels is the
:py:func:`drjit.kernel_history` API, which returns a list of kernel calls with
high-resolution timing data.

Integration
-----------

Dr.Jit has builtin support for the `NVIDIA Nsight System
<https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems>`__ performance analysis tool. You
can use the following two functions to visually mark points and regions of the
program execution so that they can be more easily identified.

- :py:func:`drjit.profile_mark`
- :py:func:`drjit.profile_range`
