**Dr.Jit** is a *just-in-time* (JIT) compiler for ordinary and differentiable
computation. It was originally created as the numerical foundation of `Mitsuba
3 <https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3>`_, a differentiable `Monte
Carlo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method>`_ renderer. Over time,
*Dr.Jit* has become a general-purpose tool that can also help with various
other types of embarrassingly parallel computation.

If you're new Dr.Jit, start by reading the section :ref:`"What is Dr.Jit?"
<what_is_drjit>` and continue through the subsequent sections in order. A
separate :ref:`reference <reference>` provides detailed specifications of the
public API.
